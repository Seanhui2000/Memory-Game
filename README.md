# Memory-Game

The Memory Game is a colorful, visually-appealling, and fully interactive program that generates a 5x5 grid of unknown pictures. To play, simply click on any box and a picture of a monkey will flip over! Match this monkey to an identical monkey and that will create a successful pair. By matching every unique pair, you win the game!
